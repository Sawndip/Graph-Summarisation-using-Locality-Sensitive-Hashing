# Graph Summarisation using Locality Sensitive Hashing
This project aims to summarise a given graph with as little information loss as possible. A given graph is grouped into buckets based on the logarithm of the degree of vertices. The subgraphs containing the vertices in each bucket are passed through a Locality Sensitive Hashing Algorithm to group the vertices into bins. A further scoring procedure is implemented on each bin based on the number of neighbours in the bin for a vertex divided by the degree of the vertex. This scoring is used to group the bins into stars/bi-partites or cliques. This process of compressing the graph into stars/bi-partites and cliques using L.S.H was found to capture the information from the graph as when we further decompressed the graph and calculated the information loss, it was found to be reasonably low.
